# Measles Outbreak of 2025 Web Map

## Introduction
This web map application is used to show the location (county-level) of Measles outbreaks in the United States in 2025. A choropleth map is placed behind the point level data and shows the total number of cases within a state. This was developed as a helpful visualization to a ABC News article on the United States potentially losing its Measles elimination status. https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-risk-losing-measles-elimination-status/story?id=127763508
## Map objectives
- Understand the geography of measles spread
